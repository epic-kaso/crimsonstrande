                                One day I was waiting for a train in London when this announcement came over the station speakers: “Can a hygiene operative please attend the primary customer zone.” The message was repeated three times before an exasperated voice shouted, “Can a cleaner please come to the ticket office.”<br>
                                <br>
                                The point I’m trying to make is this: Modern corporate culture with its love of jargon and complex process can sometimes stop us getting the job done.<br>
                                <br>
                                Why ? Because the rational world of business often overlooks the fact that whatever our role – CEO, Director or Manager – we are all human with an in-built set of powerful skills such as imagination, emotional intelligence, intuition and common sense that can produce incredible results but are hard to quantify in a spreadsheet.<br>
                                <br>
                                Our aim is to help you transform your company’s culture by encouraging everyone from the Chairman down to use these essential human skills to make them even more effective at work.<br>
                                <br>
                                To do this we use the ‘Three Ps’: <em>Provocation. Pragmatism. Personality</em>.<br>
                                <br>
                                After we work with you and your team to gain everyone’s trust, we guide you on a journey to explore and discover different ways of thinking, behaving and achieving at work – at a pace you all feel comfortable with.		</div>

                                <p class="p1">
                                    The arrival of a new CEO was the perfect opportunity to refresh the company from top to bottom. Although its products were innovative, including drug treatments for ulcers and asthma, the company’s culture had grown stale. The core problem was a senior management team, most of whose roles hadn’t changed for a considerable time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Although executives remaining in the same position for many years used to be common in France, Thom believes it resulted in a culture where timely decisions were not made, risks were avoided and young talent was blocked from the top, making retention difficult. Fortunately for the company, the new CEO saw the roots of the problem and had the vision to “shake things up”. So, soon after arriving in his post, he invited Phoenix Obsidian to work with him to change the pharmaceutical company’s culture from the top down.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The key challenge for Thom and his French associate Patricia Bouvard was to give senior managers the confidence to behave differently. Simply telling everyone below them that things were going to be different wouldn’t bring about the transformation the company clearly needed.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “You can’t impose a new vision and values on people,” says Thom. “They need to see the new behaviours being lived every day by senior management. When that happens, the vision and particularly the values can cascade all the way down the organisation.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To change the behaviour of the senior team, Thom and Patricia used a method that is based on masks representing different characters from the 14th century Italian theatre, the Commedia dell’Arte. The personality of each character was identified by the group of executives and then they were invited to try on the mask they felt best represented their own character. Next, they were encouraged to try a different character that was nothing like them. The result, says Patricia, was amazing.			</p>	
                                <p>	
                                    “The masks changed the way that people looked at each other. The team could then understand and recognise how people are different and they learnt to be more tolerant of each other. This leads to more adaptability and flexibility. You recognise how you look at people and how they look at you”, said the CEO.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “People lost their inhibitions very quickly. For the first time in a long time, the executives began to open up and talk honestly about the company. Those historic masks gave them a new burst of life.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For over two years, Phoenix Obsidian continued to work with the company. Over that time, the company’s whole culture was transformed as everyone from senior managers to cleaners, developed new ways of expressing themselves and dealing with difficult issues – thanks in no small part to the seven main characters from the Commedia dell’Arte.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “The masks helped create a new language while the new culture was being introduced,” reflects Thom. “Executives started to say, for instance: ‘You’re acting like a real Pulcinella’. It made resolving conflicts easier and less personal. Everything began to flow again.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not everyone experienced the cultural shift first-hand. The company’s all-important sales team of 150 were constantly travelling around France. To make sure they also benefited from the newly energised organisation, the CEO invited Thom and his team to Cannes where the sales people worked together and met with new eyes the executive team they had once considered cold, stuffy and remote.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    To break down barriers built up over many years, Thom gave the salespeople Harry Potter Lego sets to play with. Before long, old misgivings were replaced with camaraderie and miniature versions of Hogwarts.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “I wanted to encourage everyone to have fun building things together,” he says. “As you expect from Harry Potter, it worked like magic.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Not long after the successful transformation of the company, and Thom and Patricia had packed away their masks and wands, the company was taken over by a large multinational.			</p>

                                <p class="p1">
                                    After years of expansion through mergers and acquisitions, the American-based company found itself with divisions in a variety of countries, senior executives from over 20 nationalities but no clear vision or sense of espoused cultural identity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “It’s a common problem as companies evolve and the personal influence of the founder is diluted,” says Thom Dennis. “Apple is still Steve Jobs. But for how much longer?”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So when the Phoenix Obsidian team were asked to rejuvenate a customer focus programme for the company, they set out to develop a new approach that took into account the diverse cultural mix of its senior managers and also their different professional backgrounds. Many began their working lives on the oil rigs where work only stopped for meals as there was nothing else to do. This 24/7 work culture created problems when it was transported to their roles on dry land.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “Colleagues who didn’t come from rigs found it bizarre,” points out Thom. “So there were two separate work cultures on top of the international mix.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    From the outset, Thom saw the role of the members of his team as those of diplomats. Rather than expect everyone to conform to one style of workshop, they adapted their methods to suit the different national sensibilities they came across. 			</p>	
                                <p>	
                                    “The Americans liked everything upbeat,” he recalls. “But managers from South East Asia, for instance tend to be more reserved and wary of failure. It was important to make sure they never lost face in front of their colleagues.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    With such a complex blend of nationalities, the temptation was to create a programme to match. But when it came to explaining why managers were losing business to start-up companies, the team decided to keep things simple. They invited a client to tell executives to their faces what it was like being a customer, what was going well and what aspects needed improving.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “Looking someone in the eye and telling them why the next piece of business might not be coming their way cuts across national boundaries,” Thom reflected.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    They might have raised eyebrows at the United Nations but the team’s down-to-earth style of diplomacy worked wonders. At the end of one session, a manager immediately emailed an angry customer who was refusing to pay a bill to say sorry: “The customer paid a disputed invoice of $4.5m shortly afterwards.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Although the Phoenix Obsidian team adapted its techniques to suit the audience, the end result was the same. By the time they finished working with the diverse group, all the senior executives had a clear understanding of what their company stood for and how these positive attributes could be conveyed to customers to secure more business in the future – and as a bonus get a disputed multimillion dollar bill resolved.			</p>

Keep up the good work, as you know we need the education, and please pass on my thanks to the team for a job well done!<span class="2">”</span>				<div class="dedicace">

                                <p class="p1">
                                    The arrival of an American head of department threatened to disturb the peaceful neutrality inside the Swiss pharmaceutical company’s headquarters. Despite overseeing a team made up of Swiss nationals who all spoke French, the new executive pushed for the meeting to take place in English.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “He argued that English was the company’s language,” says Thom Dennis “But we took a more pragmatic view.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    For the Phoenix Obsidian team, solidarity is vital to changing a company’s culture and improving the effectiveness of its people. Where possible, senior management should seek to persuade an organisation that transformation is needed, rather than impose change from above. The team’s mantra is ‘Pace and Lead’.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “You have to be sensitive to the people who work in a company. After all, they are the key to its success. It’s important you introduce change at a pace that brings people on-board whilst creating the necessary momentum. The pace normally ends up being very fast, but your efforts will be wasted if you lose everyone at the beginning.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    At this pharmaceutical company, the team were faced with a department of what they called “proud French speakers”. The team ethos suggested that conducting workshops solely in English would be a grave mistake.			</p>	
                                <p>	
                                    “The new manager needed to gain their trust. Forcing everyone to use English from the start would have been insensitive and provocative.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    So when the American executive came to deliver his all-important ‘vision’ speech to his new department, the team advised him to use two PowerPoint presentations: one in English, one in French. The team also brought forward a French-speaking associate who facilitated the team-building workshops.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    When the employees saw the French version of his speech, the atmosphere in the department improved immediately. The Alpine chill that threatened to hamper a constructive dialogue between the executive and his colleagues soon began to thaw as they realised he was willing to respect their sensitivities and meet them half-way.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “The minute that French presentation came on the screen, everyone relaxed. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a room of people smile at a PowerPoint.”			</p>

                                    The world of luxury goods moves faster than most. While we enjoy summer, the industry plans what we’ll want in winter. So when a new managing director arrived at the brand’s London office, he was immediately snowed under by day-to-day business.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “From day one, I was sucked into operational matters,” he says. “I had no time to think about where we were going as a brand.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Although Thom is a man of action, he believes the power to think before you act is a leader’s greatest weapon. So he gave the luxury label’s new boss the support he needed to step back from daily operations and reflect on the company’s past victories and future success.			</p>	
                                <p>	
                                    A key part of this vital ‘thinking time’ was spent considering the needs of the team. Remembers Thom, “Everyone needed to know where they were heading and the most effective and efficient way for each of them to reach that destination.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thom advised the executive to focus on identifying goals for the brand, setting targets for his team and making sure the resources were available to achieve those objectives. He also proposed a long-term change in his client’s working methods that involved building his entire schedule around planning the brand’s direction and only getting into operational matters when they were new, important or going badly wrong.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Says Thom: “Creating the time to think transforms a manager into a leader.” 			</p>

                                    On 11th September 2001, people working on the trading floor of this international bank’s London HQ were traumatised by the terrible events taking place in New York. Many of their colleagues across the ocean were affected. Days later, one senior manager asked the question: “What should I have done in those moments?”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “There are thousands of books on leadership,” says Thom. “But they count for nothing if you can’t relate the material to the real life situations business leaders face everyday.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Armed with this simple insight, Thom began the process of rebuilding the executive’s confidence in his leadership skills. In particular, he addressed the decisions made on 11th September with a view to establishing an important truth applicable to many business situations: There is no right answer.			</p>	
                                <p>	
                                    “Being a strong leader isn’t about being perfect,” insists Thom. “It’s about having the courage to take tough decisions in tough times. People look to you to show them the way. Reaching for a textbook on leadership doesn’t inspire confidence. You have to rely on your own judgment and follow it through.”<br>

                                    At the end of their time together, the bank’s executive felt at ease with his handling of those devastating events. More importantly, he realised that replaying the day to see what he could have done differently was useless.<br>

                                    “Ultimately, he did what every good leader must do,” says Thom. “He made a decision and he made it work.”			</p>

                                                        The arrival of a new CEO was the perfect opportunity to refresh the company from top to bottom. Although its products were innovative, including drug treatments for ulcers and asthma, the company’s culture had grown stale. The core problem was a senior management team, most of whose roles hadn’t changed for a considerable time.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Although executives remaining in the same position for many years used to be common in France, Thom believes it resulted in a culture where timely decisions were not made, risks were avoided and young talent was blocked from the top, making retention difficult. Fortunately for the company, the new CEO saw the roots of the problem and had the vision to "shake things up". So, soon after arriving in his post, he invited Phoenix Obsidian to work with him to change the pharmaceutical company’s culture from the top down.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        The key challenge for Thom and his French associate Patricia Bouvard was to give senior managers the confidence to behave differently. Simply telling everyone below them that things were going to be different wouldn’t bring about the transformation the company clearly needed.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "You can’t impose a new vision and values on people," says Thom. "They need to see the new behaviours being lived every day by senior management. When that happens, the vision and particularly the values can cascade all the way down the organisation."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        To change the behaviour of the senior team, Thom and Patricia used a method that is based on masks representing different characters from the 14th century Italian theatre, the Commedia dell’Arte. The personality of each character was identified by the group of executives and then they were invited to try on the mask they felt best represented their own character. Next, they were encouraged to try a different character that was nothing like them. The result, says Patricia, was amazing.
                                                </p>	
                                                <p>	
                                                        "The masks changed the way that people looked at each other. The team could then understand and recognise how people are different and they learnt to be more tolerant of each other. This leads to more adaptability and flexibility. You recognise how you look at people and how they look at you", said the CEO. 
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "People lost their inhibitions very quickly. For the first time in a long time, the executives began to open up and talk honestly about the company. Those historic masks gave them a new burst of life."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        For over two years, Phoenix Obsidian continued to work with the company. Over that time, the company’s whole culture was transformed as everyone from senior managers to cleaners, developed new ways of expressing themselves and dealing with difficult issues – thanks in no small part to the seven main characters from the Commedia dell’Arte.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "The masks helped create a new language while the new culture was being introduced," reflects Thom. "Executives started to say, for instance: 'You're acting like a real Pulcinella'. It made resolving conflicts easier and less personal. Everything began to flow again."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Not everyone experienced the cultural shift first-hand. The company’s all-important sales team of 150 were constantly travelling around France. To make sure they also benefited from the newly energised organisation, the CEO invited Thom and his team to Cannes where the sales people worked together and met with new eyes the executive team they had once considered cold, stuffy and remote.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        To break down barriers built up over many years, Thom gave the salespeople Harry Potter Lego sets to play with. Before long, old misgivings were replaced with camaraderie and miniature versions of Hogwarts.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "I wanted to encourage everyone to have fun building things together,” he says. “As you expect from Harry Potter, it worked like magic."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Not long after the successful transformation of the company, and Thom and Patricia had packed away their masks and wands, the company was taken over by a large multinational.

                                                        After years of expansion through mergers and acquisitions, the American-based company found itself with divisions in a variety of countries, senior executives from over 20 nationalities but no clear vision or sense of espoused cultural identity.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "It’s a common problem as companies evolve and the personal influence of the founder is diluted,” says Thom Dennis. “Apple is still Steve Jobs. But for how much longer?"
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        So when the Phoenix Obsidian team were asked to rejuvenate a customer focus programme for the company, they set out to develop a new approach that took into account the diverse cultural mix of its senior managers and also their different professional backgrounds. Many began their working lives on the oil rigs where work only stopped for meals as there was nothing else to do. This 24/7 work culture created problems when it was transported to their roles on dry land.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "Colleagues who didn’t come from rigs found it bizarre," points out Thom. "So there were two separate work cultures on top of the international mix."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        From the outset, Thom saw the role of the members of his team as those of diplomats. Rather than expect everyone to conform to one style of workshop, they adapted their methods to suit the different national sensibilities they came across. 
                                                </p>

                                                        "The Americans liked everything upbeat," he recalls. "But managers from South East Asia, for instance tend to be more reserved and wary of failure. It was important to make sure they never lost face in front of their colleagues."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        With such a complex blend of nationalities, the temptation was to create a programme to match. But when it came to explaining why managers were losing business to start-up companies, the team decided to keep things simple. They invited a client to tell executives to their faces what it was like being a customer, what was going well and what aspects needed improving.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "Looking someone in the eye and telling them why the next piece of business might not be coming their way cuts across national boundaries," Thom reflected.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        They might have raised eyebrows at the United Nations but the team’s down-to-earth style of diplomacy worked wonders. At the end of one session, a manager immediately emailed an angry customer who was refusing to pay a bill to say sorry: “The customer paid a disputed invoice of $4.5m shortly afterwards.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Although the Phoenix Obsidian team adapted its techniques to suit the audience, the end result was the same. By the time they finished working with the diverse group, all the senior executives had a clear understanding of what their company stood for and how these positive attributes could be conveyed to customers to secure more business in the future – and as a bonus get a disputed multimillion dollar bill resolved.

                                                        The arrival of an American head of department threatened to disturb the peaceful neutrality inside the Swiss pharmaceutical company’s headquarters. Despite overseeing a team made up of Swiss nationals who all spoke French, the new executive pushed for the meeting to take place in English.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        "He argued that English was the company’s language," says Thom Dennis "But we took a more pragmatic view."
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        For the Phoenix Obsidian team, solidarity is vital to changing a company’s culture and improving the effectiveness of its people. Where possible, senior management should seek to persuade an organisation that transformation is needed, rather than impose change from above. The team’s mantra is ‘Pace and Lead’. 
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        “You have to be sensitive to the people who work in a company. After all, they are the key to its success. It’s important you introduce change at a pace that brings people on-board whilst creating the necessary momentum. The pace normally ends up being very fast, but your efforts will be wasted if you lose everyone at the beginning.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        At this pharmaceutical company, the team were faced with a department of what they called “proud French speakers”. The team ethos suggested that conducting workshops solely in English would be a grave mistake.
                                                </p>	
                                                <p>	
                                                        “The new manager needed to gain their trust. Forcing everyone to use English from the start would have been insensitive and provocative.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        So when the American executive came to deliver his all-important ‘vision’ speech to his new department, the team advised him to use two PowerPoint presentations: one in English, one in French. The team also brought forward a French-speaking associate who facilitated the team-building workshops.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        When the employees saw the French version of his speech, the atmosphere in the department improved immediately. The Alpine chill that threatened to hamper a constructive dialogue between the executive and his colleagues soon began to thaw as they realised he was willing to respect their sensitivities and meet them half-way.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        “The minute that French presentation came on the screen, everyone relaxed. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a room of people smile at a PowerPoint.”

                                                        The world of luxury goods moves faster than most. While we enjoy summer, the industry plans what we’ll want in winter. So when a new managing director arrived at the brand’s London office, he was immediately snowed under by day-to-day business.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        “From day one, I was sucked into operational matters,” he says. “I had no time to think about where we were going as a brand.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Although Thom is a man of action, he believes the power to think before you act is a leader’s greatest weapon. So he gave the luxury label’s new boss the support he needed to step back from daily operations and reflect on the company’s past victories and future success.
                                                </p>	
                                                <p>
                                                        A key part of this vital ‘thinking time’ was spent considering the needs of the team. Remembers Thom, “Everyone needed to know where they were heading and the most effective and efficient way for each of them to reach that destination.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Thom advised the executive to focus on identifying goals for the brand, setting targets for his team and making sure the resources were available to achieve those objectives. He also proposed a long-term change in his client’s working methods that involved building his entire schedule around planning the brand’s direction and only getting into operational matters when they were new, important or going badly wrong.
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Says Thom: “Creating the time to think transforms a manager into a leader.”

                                                        On 11th September 2001, people working on the trading floor of this international bank’s London HQ were traumatised by the terrible events taking place in New York. Many of their colleagues across the ocean were affected.  Days later, one senior manager asked the question: “What should I have done in those moments?” 
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        “There are thousands of books on leadership,” says Thom. “But they count for nothing if you can’t relate the material to the real life situations business leaders face everyday.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        Armed with this simple insight, Thom began the process of rebuilding the executive’s confidence in his leadership skills. In particular, he addressed the decisions made on 11th September with a view to establishing an important truth applicable to many business situations: There is no right answer.
                                                </p>	
                                                <p>
                                                        “Being a strong leader isn’t about being perfect,” insists Thom. “It’s about having the courage to take tough decisions in tough times. People look to you to show them the way. Reaching for a textbook on leadership doesn’t inspire confidence. You have to rely on your own judgment and follow it through.”
                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        At the end of their time together, the Citigroup executive felt at ease with his handling of those devastating events. More importantly, he realised that replaying the day to see what he could have done differently was useless. 
                                                        <br /><br />

                                                        <br /><br />
                                                        “Ultimately, he did what every good leader must do,” says Thom. “He made a decision and he made it work.”

That’s my view after seeing Thom at work. When I asked him to facilitate a very important leadership team meeting, he worked closely with me to plan every detail, design the agenda and look out for potential pitfalls that might derail us. He also ensured everyone taking part agreed to the objectives before we began. Thanks to Thom’s expert knowledge and hard work, the meeting was extremely productive and rewarding. What’s more, his light touch and easy manner made us all feel it was our success.<span class="after">&nbsp;</span>
